# Containers: [SYSTEM NAME]

**C4 level**: 2 - Container | **Last updated**: [DATE] | **Updated for**: [###-feature-name or "initial"]
**Related views**: [System context](./context.md) | [Data model](./erd.md)

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the example diagram and tables with the real system.
  A container is something that must be running for the system to work: an
  application, a service, a database, a queue, a file store. Do not show components.
  People and external systems must match context.md exactly.
