{CORE_TEMPLATE}

## C4 Architecture Diagrams

This section adds a step to **Phase 1: Design & Contracts**. Run it after
`data-model.md` and `contracts/` are written, because the diagrams are derived from
them.

**Locations.** Read `.specify/extensions/c4/c4-config.yml` if it exists; otherwise
use `architecture_dir: docs/architecture` and `feature_file: architecture.md`.
`ARCH_DIR` is `architecture_dir` from the repository root. `FEATURE_ARCH` is
`<feature_file>` in the feature directory, next to IMPL_PLAN.

**If `.specify/extensions/c4/templates/` does not exist**, the `c4` extension is not
installed. Skip this section, leave the plan's `## Architecture` section as
`Not generated: c4 extension not installed`, and say so in the Completion Report.

1. **Read the rules**: read `.specify/extensions/c4/templates/c4-conventions.md` in
   full. Every diagram must follow it.

2. **Load the system views**: read `ARCH_DIR/context.md`, `ARCH_DIR/containers.md`
   and `ARCH_DIR/erd.md` when they exist and reuse their element aliases, labels and
   technologies exactly. If they do not exist, treat every container and entity as
   new.

3. **Generate `FEATURE_ARCH`** from
   `.specify/extensions/c4/templates/c4-feature-architecture-template.md`:
   - **Header**: feature name, branch, date, and relative links to the spec, plan,
     data model, contracts and the three system views. Drop links to artifacts this
     run did not produce.
   - **Components**: one `C4Component` diagram and component table per container
     this feature adds or changes, consistent with Technical Context and the source
     tree in Project Structure.
   - **Flows**: one `sequenceDiagram` per user story's primary path, in priority
     order, plus architecturally significant alternate or failure paths. Message
     labels match `contracts/`. Name the user story and the requirements covered.
   - **Data**: one `erDiagram` with every entity in `data-model.md`, with
     attributes, keys and relationships. Write `Not applicable: [reason]` if the
     feature has no persistent data.
   - **Architecture Impact**: every difference between these diagrams and the system
     views.
   - Leave no placeholder text and none of the template's example content.

4. **Fill the plan's `## Architecture` section** in IMPL_PLAN: correct relative
   links and a one-line impact per view.

5. **Fill the spec's `## System Context` section** in FEATURE_SPEC only if it still
   contains unfilled placeholders: set the link to `ARCH_DIR/context.md` and list
   the people and external systems from the spec. Make no other change to the spec.

6. **Extend the outputs**:
   - Add `architecture.md` to the documentation tree under "Project Structure" in
     IMPL_PLAN, as a Phase 1 output.
   - Include `FEATURE_ARCH` among the generated artifacts in the Completion Report,
     with the count of component, sequence and ER diagrams.

Do not edit the project-level views in `ARCH_DIR` during planning. They are updated
from the Architecture Impact table by `__SPECKIT_COMMAND_C4_SYSTEM__` once the
feature is implemented.
