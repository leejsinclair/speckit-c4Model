# Validate Architecture Diagrams

Check the current feature's architecture document and the project-level views
against the C4 conventions and against the documents they are derived from.

**This command is read-only. Do not create or modify any project file.** Report
findings and let the user decide what to fix.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty). It may limit
the check to the feature or to the project-level views.

## Configuration

Read `.specify/extensions/c4/c4-config.yml` if it exists. Use these defaults for any
key that is missing or when the file is absent:

- `architecture_dir`: `docs/architecture`
- `feature_file`: `architecture.md`

## Steps

1. **Read the rules.** Read `templates/c4-conventions.md` in full.

2. **Locate the documents.** Run the prerequisites script from the repository root
   and parse `FEATURE_DIR`, `FEATURE_SPEC` and `IMPL_PLAN`:
   - **Bash**: `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --paths-only`
   - **PowerShell**: `.specify/scripts/powershell/check-prerequisites.ps1 -Json -PathsOnly`

   The documents to check are `FEATURE_DIR/<feature_file>` and `context.md`,
   `containers.md` and `erd.md` under `architecture_dir`. Check the ones that
   exist. If none exist, report that there is nothing to validate, name the command
   that creates each (`__SPECKIT_COMMAND_C4_FEATURE__`,
   `__SPECKIT_COMMAND_C4_SYSTEM__`), and stop.

3. **Syntax.** For every Mermaid block in those documents:
   - If the `mmdc` command is available, extract each block to a temporary file
     outside the repository and run `mmdc -i <file> -o <file>.svg`. A non-zero exit
     is a syntax finding; quote the parser message.
   - Otherwise review the block by hand: it starts with a valid diagram type, every
     macro and arrow is in the allowed subset from the conventions, brackets and
     quotes balance, and every alias used in a relationship is declared. State in
     the report that syntax was reviewed manually, not parsed.

4. **Rendered readability.** When `mmdc` is available, inspect the rendered C4
   diagrams as well as their source. Report an **INFO** finding when a relationship
   crosses an unrelated element or label, labels overlap, relationship lines cross
   or coincide, or routes are unnecessarily long. Confirm findings in the rendering;
   syntax validity alone does not establish readability. If rendering is unavailable,
   say that layout was not visually checked.

5. **C4 rules.** Check each C4 diagram against the conventions:
   - one level per diagram, and one container per component diagram;
   - every container and component has a technology and a description;
   - every relationship has a label, and a protocol between containers;
   - no element without a relationship;
   - no leftover template placeholders (`[SYSTEM NAME]`, `[Component 1]`) or
     template example content.

6. **Consistency across views.**
   - People and external systems in `containers.md` match `context.md`.
   - Every container boundary in a feature component diagram is a container in
     `containers.md`, or is listed as `Add` in the feature's Architecture Impact
     table.
   - An element has the same alias, label and technology everywhere it appears.
   - Every database container has a section in `erd.md`.

7. **Consistency with the feature documents.**
   - Every sequence participant is an element in a C4 view.
   - Every user story in `FEATURE_SPEC` has at least one sequence diagram, and each
     diagram names the story it covers.
   - Sequence message labels correspond to operations in `contracts/`.
   - The feature ER diagram contains every entity in `data-model.md`, with matching
     attributes and relationships, and nothing that `data-model.md` lacks.
   - Every `FK` attribute has a relationship line and the reverse.
   - Technologies match `IMPL_PLAN` Technical Context.
   - The Architecture Impact table accounts for every difference between the
     feature diagrams and the project-level views.

8. **Links.** `FEATURE_SPEC` and `IMPL_PLAN` link to the architecture documents, the
   feature architecture document links back to them, and every relative link
   resolves to a file that exists.

## Report

Output a findings table, most severe first:

| ID | Severity | Document | Diagram or section | Finding | Suggested fix |
|----|----------|----------|--------------------|---------|---------------|

Severity levels:

- **ERROR**: the diagram will not render, or it contradicts the spec, plan, data
  model or contracts.
- **WARNING**: a C4 convention is broken or two views disagree.
- **INFO**: readability or completeness suggestion.

Follow the table with the count per severity, the documents checked, and whether
syntax was parsed with `mmdc` or reviewed manually. If there are no findings, say
so plainly. If there are findings, offer to fix them with
`__SPECKIT_COMMAND_C4_FEATURE__` or `__SPECKIT_COMMAND_C4_SYSTEM__`; do not apply
fixes from this command.
